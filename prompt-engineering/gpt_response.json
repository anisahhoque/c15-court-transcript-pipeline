        "description": "This immigration appeal concerns the application to discharge an anonymity order imposed on a convicted individual (SC) involved in serious criminal conduct. The judgment examines issues of open justice, the competing rights under Articles 8 and 10 of the ECHR, and procedural matters regarding the appropriate forum for appeal. It considers whether the anonymity order should continue given extensive press coverage and the risk (alleged by the parties) to family members versus the public interest.",
