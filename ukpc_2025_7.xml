	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">On or about 28 June 2013 nine employees at the appellant&#8217;s electricity plant at 100 Windward Road in the parish of Kingston were dismissed. Seven of those employees belonged to the National Workers Union (&#8220;the NWU&#8221;) and two of them belonged to the Union of Clerical, Administrative and Supervisory Employees (&#8220;UCASE&#8221;) (together &#8220;the unions&#8221;). Both those unions have bargaining rights for certain categories of workers employed by the appellant (&#8220;Private Power&#8221;) for the purposes of the Labour Relations and Industrial Disputes Act enacted in 1975 (&#8220;LRIDA&#8221;). </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The news of the pending dismissals resulted in the unions serving a strike notice on Private Power on 24 June 2013. This led in turn to the intervention of the Honourable Minister of Labour and Social Security. On 5 July 2013, the Minister referred the disputes to the Industrial Disputes Tribunal (&#8220;the IDT&#8221;) for settlement. The IDT is a statutory body established pursuant to section 7 of LRIDA. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">There were two references made by the Minister to the IDT under section 9(3)(a) of LRIDA, one in respect of the two members of UCASE and one in respect of the seven members of the NWU. The terms of reference required the IDT to determine and settle the dispute between Private Power on the one hand and the relevant union on the other. The panel appointed to determine both disputes was made up of Mr Norman Wright KC (chairman) sitting with Mr Rion Hall JP and Mr D Trevor McNish. They dealt with the two references together and held a hearing spread over 47 sittings between 13 March 2014 and 18 January 2016. </p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The IDT published two awards on 5 April 2016 and concluded that all nine dismissals had been unjustified: see awards IDT 27/2013 (UCASE) and IDT 28/2013 (NWU). The main reasons for that conclusion were that Private Power failed properly to consult the unions about the redundancies in accordance with the requirements laid down in section 11 of the Labour Relations Code (&#8220;the Code&#8221;) and that the process by which the employees were selected for dismissal was unfair. </p>

Private Power&#8217;s further appeal to the Court of Appeal was also dismissed in a judgment handed down on 26 March 2021: see [2021] JMCA Civ 18. The judgment of the Court of Appeal was given by Dunbar-Green JA (Ag) with McDonald-Bishop JA and Simmons JA concurring. Private Power now appeals to the Privy Council.</p>

Section 9 of that Act provides that any industrial dispute existing in an undertaking which provides an essential service may be reported to the Minister by any party to the dispute. Subject to exceptions which are not relevant here, the Minister must then refer the dispute to the IDT. The IDT is then bound to make its award and it may set out the reasons for the award if it thinks necessary or expedient to do so: section 12(3). According to section 12(4)(c), an award is final and conclusive and &#8220;no proceedings shall be brought in any court to impeach the validity thereof, except on a point of law.&#8221;</p>

Their Lordships endorsed the descriptions of the Code that had been given by the lower courts in those proceedings as establishing an environment in which the relationships and communications between the employers, the workers and the unions should operate for the peaceful solution of conflicts which are bound to develop. The Board in that case rejected a suggestion that the Code was no more than a set of guidelines and accepted the submission of the IDT that it was &#8220;as near to law as you can get&#8221;: para 6.</p>

The first issue for their determination in both cases was whether a redundancy situation had existed at the plant. On that issue they concluded that Private Power had established that a genuine redundancy situation existed at the relevant time. The managerial decision to reduce the workforce was one which a reasonable employer could have reached in light of its assessment of the plant&#8217;s technical and economic efficiency. </p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The second issue addressed by the IDT was the consultation with the unions. They set out sections 11 and 19 of the Code and then described the communications passing between Private Power and the unions and the meetings that had been held. The narrative started with a short letter dated 31 December 2012 simply inviting the unions to a meeting &#8220;to discuss a proposed restructuring exercise for the company&#8221;. The IDT noted that the letter made no mention of redundancy. The union representative responded that he was not prepared to come to a meeting without some better idea of what the proposed restructuring might involve. Private Power wrote to him saying that there were no documents relating to the proposed restructuring exercise and as a consequence, nothing that they could share with him at that point. A meeting was, however, held between Private Power and the unions on 21 January 2013. On 23 January 2023 there was a meeting of the management with all staff where the employees were handed a memo referring to the difficult challenges facing the company and telling them that the unions had been advised of issues &#8220;including but not limited to the possibility of a reduction of the existing workforce&#8221;.</p>

That letter referred to &#8220;changing economic environments&#8221; and to the objective of the restructuring exercise being &#8220;to better position the company to adapt to these changing business conditions&#8221;. The letter referred to the need for &#8220;rectifying inefficiencies&#8221; and for reducing costs and improving efficiency. Seven initiatives were listed in the letter as the options being evaluated by Private Power including the introduction of shift work, reduced use of casual or temporary employees, a wage freeze, unpaid leave and redundancy of some members of the workforce. </p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">In their reply dated 27 February 2013, the unions picked up on the reference in that letter to possible redundancies. The unions recommended that the management look at management, maintenance and overseas contractor costs and to their &#8220;management style and policies etc&#8221; if they wanted to return the company to its former efficiency. They asked the company &#8220;to be much more open and transparent with the necessary information such as your various costs of operations, in compliance with section 19 of the Labour Relations Code 1976&#8221;.</p>

Neither the letters, nor the meeting, nor a statement that the company had made directly to the workforce on 23 January 2013, conveyed &#8220;a clear and precise decision on redundancies&#8221;. On the contrary, in response to the reference to redundancy made by the unions in their letter of 27 February, Private Power responded on 1 March 2013 by letter pointing out that redundancy was one of a number of initiatives to reduce costs and improve efficiency. The letter said: &#8220;It was not the only item for consideration&#8221;. The IDT noted &#8220;Again, there is no clear, concrete or definitely stated position by the Company to the Union, that redundancies will take place&#8221; (para 35 of the awards).</p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in"> The parties were then at an impasse with the unions asking for audited information about operating costs before they were prepared to meet again with management. There was a further meeting on 10 April 2013 at which, according to Private Power, it presented a number of technical strategies to meet its objective and not just a reduction in the labour force. The management wrote again to the unions on 24 April suggesting meeting dates in mid-May. The unions responded again saying that Private Power&#8217;s &#8220;financial woes&#8221; were the fault of poor management and asserting that the plant was in fact understaffed so that any overrun of the budget &#8220;would be as a result of weak management and not workers&#8217; fault&#8221;.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">It is also the contention of the Union that there was no consultation on redundancy, as there was no decision to effect redundancies communicated to them. The evidence plainly indicated that the Union was invited to meet to discuss, not even a restructuring exercise but a &#8216;proposed restructuring exercise.&#8217; It is noted that there was no invitation to discuss the matter of redundancy. The question may be asked is whether this is semantic. The Tribunal thinks not, because it is long established in the field of Human Resources Management and Industrial Relations that this is not necessarily the case. Restructuring may lead to a redundancy situation or it may not. A redundancy situation may arise as a result of a restructuring but there is no necessary connection between the two. &#8230;</p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The IDT said at para 44 that a critical factor was that the selection criteria had to be agreed by both parties.

The IDT cited a passage from Browne-Wilkinson J&#8217;s judgment in that case in which he said, among other things, &#8220;In particular, the employer will seek to agree with the Union the criteria to be applied in selecting the employees to be made redundant&#8221; (<span style="font-style:italic">Compair </span>at p 162).

Clause 20 provided that the employee who, in the opinion of Private Power, had the greatest skill, competence and efficiency would be given preference for retention. The IDT noted further that the prescribed Selection Matrix Form used to score the employees who might be dismissed had &#8220;performance&#8221; as one of the criteria to be evaluated but it was not used in this exercise. The IDT concluded at para 47:</p>

At para 72, the judge accepted the IDT&#8217;s submission that references by Private Power to &#8220;reorganisation&#8221; did not indicate to the unions or to the employees that redundancy was an option being explored. She said: &#8220;When matters of this nature are being explored which will have an overreaching effect on people&#8217;s lives, clear and precise terms must be used for the avoidance of doubt.&#8221; But she also accepted Private Power&#8217;s contention that the IDT had erred in construing section 11 of the Code as requiring that consultation only begins where an employer informs the unions that redundancies are &#8220;definitely on&#8221;. She found that consultation had started on 12 February 2013 but that it was still ineffective, having regard to the requirements of section 19(a) of the Code. She accepted that the unions were tardy in how they handled the invitations relevant to consultation sent out to them by Private Power and that the unions had frustrated attempts to engage in consultation.

Rather, the IDT had said that &#8220;there ought to have been, in the specific circumstances of this case, consultation and discussion when redundancy was definitely on, with a view to taking reasonable steps to avoid it, not when a decision had already been made and it would be futile and of no effect to consult&#8221;: para 79.</p>

The Board there discussed a number of Privy Council appeals in which employment tribunals and other judicial bodies had taken an active role in opposing appeals. The Board also referred to Canadian authorities in which such a practice was strongly deprecated as discrediting the impartiality of the tribunal: see the cases discussed at paras 45 to 49 of the <span style="font-style:italic">Estate Police Association</span> decision.

But the parties did at times attempt to supplement the reasoning as set out in the published awards or to put a gloss on the words used there. Similarly, Private Power&#8217;s arguments sometimes sought to rely on the written or oral submissions that the IDT had made to Fraser J or to the Court of Appeal as modifying the content of the decisions. The Board is clear that this is a temptation that must be resisted by both sides. It is not legitimate for either party to treat the tribunal as being in a special position as regards interpreting the reasoning set out in the decision. The reasons for the decision are those, and only those, set out in the published version. Amplification of those reasons is neither helpful nor appropriate.</p>

The reason given for the application was that Private Power &#8220;has since established&#8221; that there was no collective labour agreement in place between Private Power and UCASE. The IDT objected to the proposed amendment on the grounds that the application was an improper attempt to advance a new ground of appeal without first seeking special leave to appeal from the Board having already been granted leave to appeal by the Court of Appeal. At the start of the hearing before the Board, the Board indicated that it would hear argument on the merits of the proposed further ground without deciding whether to allow the amendment.

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">On the issue of whether there was a failure to consult the unions in breach of the Code, Private Power submitted that Fraser J had been correct to identify an error of law in the IDT&#8217;s decision concerning when its obligation to consult arose. The Court of Appeal had been wrong to overturn that finding. The IDT had found that the obligation to consult arose only once redundancies were &#8220;definitely on&#8221; and that that situation had been arrived at only on 19 June 2013. As a result of that conclusion, the IDT then wrongly focused on the period which started on 19 June 2013 when, they thought, the obligation to consult arose and ended on 29 June when the dismissals took place. The IDT then evaluated only the correspondence and meetings over that short period when considering the adequacy of the consultation. Unsurprisingly they concluded that there was no adequate consultation during that short period. </p>

In light of that, it was important for the judge to re-evaluate the question of whether there had been adequate consultation by looking at the whole history of the contact between Private Power and the unions from December 2012 through to the dismissals at the end of June. A fresh evaluation of that evidence should have led to the conclusion either that there had been sufficient consultation over that six month period or, if there had not, that that was the result of tardiness and lack of co-operation on the part of the unions. Further, such consideration as Fraser J did give to the whole period was muddled by her conclusion that Private Power could and should have negotiated directly with the workers if the unions had not been co-operating. The Court of Appeal correctly found that Fraser J had erred on that point. </p>

The IDT and the Court of Appeal correctly understood the obligations arising from section 11(ii) and (iii) of the Code. Section 11(ii) does not identify any particular period over which the duty to consult arises before employees are dismissed; nor would it be sensible to do so given that the need for a reduction in the work force may arise suddenly or become apparent gradually. The IDT clearly understood the key point which is that in order for such consultation truly to be aimed at taking &#8220;all reasonable steps to avoid redundancies&#8221; as required by section 11(ii), the potential need to make workers redundant must, if possible, be raised fairly and squarely with the union at a time when the union can contribute meaningfully to exploring other options with the workforce. If redundancies do become necessary, then section 11(iii) requires that the consultation which takes place is aimed at minimising the hardship that will arise.</p>

The IDT set out in great detail the correspondence and the parties&#8217; evidence about what happened from December 2012 onwards, both when recording the parties&#8217; submissions about that narrative and when setting out their own conclusions. By describing the redundancies as being &#8220;a fait accompli&#8221; by the time of the 19 June meeting, the IDT clearly recognised that Private Power&#8217;s decision to make workers redundant had been arrived at some time earlier. </p>

That correspondence and the relevant witness evidence has been described in detail by the courts below: see for example the judgment of Fraser J at paras 61 and 83 to 87 and the judgment of the Court of Appeal at para 7(i) to (xii). Ms White on behalf of the IDT took the Board through the correspondence at the hearing of the appeal. The Board concludes that there is nothing in those letters that could fairly be described as consultation about redundancies. On the contrary, Ms White is right to point out that it was the unions which wanted to discuss possible redundancies and Private Power was downplaying that as a possibility. </p>

Clause 20 of the collective labour agreement (set out at para 12 above) included performance as a relevant criterion but, as the IDT noted, it was clear from the completed selection matrix forms in evidence before them that performance had not been given a value. Private Power says that the IDT&#8217;s criticism in this regard is unwarranted. The reason why performance was not included as a criterion was because not every relevant employee had had a performance appraisal. It would have been unfair to include a score for those who had had an appraisal but not to include a score for those who had not.</p>

The gravamen of the IDT&#8217;s conclusion that the adoption of the selection criteria had been unfair was that there had been no discussion with the unions about what criteria would be applied. The Board was shown two examples of completed matrices headed &#8220;Redundancy Selection Matrix Form&#8221; scoring two of the employees who were dismissed. They were both signed by the managers of the mechanical and electrical departments on 21 June 2013, two days after, as the IDT found, the unions were first properly informed of the proposed redundancies at the meeting of 19 June. The list of names of those to be dismissed was, according to Private Power&#8217;s fixed date claim form, forwarded to the unions on 26 June 2013. Mr Goffe, for Private Power, did not suggest that the other selection matrices would show any different date.

This set out the contention of the NWU that unionised workers were victimised by the selection process and that all union delegates except one were dismissed: &#8220;the Company carried out an act of Union busting by terminating mostly unionized positions unjustifiably&#8221;. The other complaint raised about selection was that those dismissed were all the trained and qualified safety experts at the plant, leaving the workplace unsafe. UCASE&#8217;s brief to the IDT was in similar terms. The briefs did not, therefore, plainly raise an issue about the absence of performance as a criterion used to select employees for dismissal. Clause 20 and the need to evaluate performance was not a point argued by the unions at the hearing before the IDT and Private Power had not been given a fair opportunity to address the point. It was unfair therefore, Private Power submits, for the IDT to rely on this point in making its awards. </p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The Board has concluded that it is not open to Private Power to raise this procedural issue for the first time before the Board. It amounts to a challenge to the fairness of the IDT&#8217;s process and should have been raised in the judicial review proceedings lodged on 28 February 2017. The fixed date claim form sets out a detailed description of the errors that it is alleged that the IDT made, including as regards the IDT&#8217;s findings in respect of the interpretation of the collective labour agreement: see paras 34 to 43. Those paragraphs do not challenge the fairness of the IDT having referred to clause 20 of the agreement but challenge the IDT&#8217;s conclusion that performance should have been included in the selection exercise. The Board therefore rejects this complaint raised by Private Power.</p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">UTECH UKPC</span>,<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>the issue was whether the role of the IDT in an unfair dismissal case was limited to asking whether the dismissal was justified by the circumstances which were known or ought to have been known to the employer at the time of the dismissal or whether the IDT could take into account matters that came to light after the dismissal. The Board upheld the conclusion of the Court of Appeal in that case that the IDT was not restricted to examining the evidence that had been before the employer&#8217;s disciplinary tribunal. The IDT could find that the decision to dismiss was one that a reasonable employer could have taken on the basis of circumstances which existed at the time of the dismissal and which came to light later: see para 27 of Lady Hale&#8217;s judgment. It was in that context that the Board referred to the IDT as having &#8220;an original jurisdiction to decide whether the dismissal was unjustifiable&#8221;. </p>

That would not entitle the IDT to adopt an unfair process by basing their decision on a point that the unions had not raised in their briefs if that had led to Private Power being taken by surprise and not having a fair opportunity to address the issue. In the event the Board is fully satisfied that no such unfairness arose in these proceedings.</p>

The point that Private Power wishes to raise is that the IDT was wrong to treat the absence of performance as a criterion as making all the dismissals unfair because there was only a collective labour agreement &#8211; and so clause 20 was only relevant &#8211; in respect of the employees who were represented by the NWU not those represented by UCASE. This element of the IDT&#8217;s reasoning could not therefore support a conclusion that the dismissals of the employees represented by the other union were unjustified.</p>

Private Power should be aware of the nature of its relationship with the unions it recognises for collective bargaining purposes. It did not raise this point in its fixed date claim form. On the contrary, it referred throughout to the two unions as &#8220;the Union&#8221; (see para 6) and its submissions on clause 20 referred to the agreement being between &#8220;the Claimant and the Union&#8221; without differentiating between the NWU and UCASE. That approach was adopted also by Ingrid Christian-Baker, the General Manager of Private Power, who provided affidavit evidence to the High Court on behalf of the company. She did not draw any distinction in her evidence between the two unions, referring to them together as &#8220;the Union&#8221; and noting that the same person was the Senior Negotiating Officer for both as she explained in para 7.1 of her affidavit in support of the application for leave to apply for judicial review. It would be wrong to allow Private Power to resile from that position now.</p>

That error is the IDT&#8217;s reliance on the <span style="font-style:italic">Compair </span>decision as authority for the need to agree or at least consult with the unions about the criteria to be applied when selecting employees for dismissal. </p>

The question is whether the element of unlawfulness has had an impact on the decision or whether it is inevitable that the IDT would have reached the same decision if it had not made the error. In the Board&#8217;s opinion, it is clear that this error does not undermine the conclusions of the IDT described above. It is not appropriate to remit the disputes.</p>

The House of Lords was considering a planning decision which was ultra vires because there had been no environmental impact assessment as required by a European Union directive. Lord Hoffmann noted that if the court upheld an ultra vires planning decision in those circumstances, that would seem to be in conflict with the court&#8217;s duty to fulfil the United Kingdom&#8217;s obligations under the relevant European Union Treaty. Further he said: &#8220;It is exceptional even in domestic law for a court to exercise its discretion not to quash a decision which has been found to be ultra vires&#8221;: see p 616. The position here is very different from that discussed in <span style="font-style:italic">Berkeley</span> and there is no justification for applying a more stringent test for remittal. </p>
