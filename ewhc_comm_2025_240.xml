	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This case concerns the contest between the Claimant (&#8220;Mr Maloney&#8221;) and the Defendant (&#8220;Falcon VII&#8221;) for the control of a company &#8211; Falcon Topco Limited (&#8220;Topco&#8221;), which is incorporated in Jersey.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As is usually the position in such cases, the respective rights and obligations of Mr Maloney and Falcon VII in relation to each other and in respect of Topco are set out in a number of related contracts and other documents, all of which cross-refer to each other. However, at the heart of the matter is a relatively straightforward issue as to the correct interpretation of one clause in one contract &#8211; clause 5.4 of the shareholders&#8217; agreement between Mr Maloney, Falcon VII, Topco and various others, dated 21 December 2018 (as subsequently varied by Deeds of Variation dated 22 February 2019 and 1 March 2020) (&#8220;the SHA&#8221;).</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A great deal is at stake, both financially and in terms of the effort and care that both sides (but especially Mr Maloney) have invested in the underlying business over a lengthy period. Both sides have worked with painstaking diligence through every conceivable point (and, perhaps, some other points as well).  I am extremely grateful for all the assistance I have received. Nevertheless, the fundamental question I have to decide is short and simple, turning as it does on a provision that runs to a single sentence.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Maloney became a director of Workhuman in 2001. His interest in Workhuman for many years was via shares held by funds managed by Balderton Capital (UK) LLP (&#8220;Balderton&#8221;), a venture capital firm in which he was then a partner.</p>

The funding for the purchase included (i) a debt package provided by ICG to Bidco and (ii) equity investments made by ICG in Topco, via Falcon VII. ICG&#8217;s debt facility was advanced by a separate SPV, Falcon VII Financing S.a.r.l. (&#8220;Falcon Financing&#8221;).</p>

The result was that Mr Maloney became the indirect holder of a 49.44% shareholding in Topco. Falcon VII had a much smaller shareholding &#8211; only 7%.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It was common ground that the parties anticipated that, all going well, Workhuman would launch an IPO within a few years, which would result in ICG&#8217;s involvement coming to an end.  There was no certainty that an IPO would be viable, so the parties ensured that the documents covering the transaction addressed not only an IPO but also a number of other outcomes that might lead to ICG&#8217;s involvement ceasing.</p>

The loan notes issued to Falcon Financing comprised US$134,888,750.06 15% secured redeemable notes (&#8220;the &#8220;SF Notes&#8221;). I have been told that the total amount (principal and interest) owed to Falcon Financing at present is roughly US$110 million.

Notably, Falcon VII acquired a 7% shareholding, but they were Original A1 shares representing 75% of the voting rights in Topco. Conversely, Mr Maloney (as Initial Lead Promoter) had majority voting control of the board of directors of each of the Buyer Group Companies, pursuant to clauses 3.1 and 3.14 of the SHA. For most of the relevant period he was the sole Promoter Director on Topco&#8217;s board, and the other directors were appointed by ICG/Falcon VII &#8211; Mr Bernard Coady and Mr Sam McKelvey. Unless and until the occurrence of a Default Event or Services Default (as defined, respectively, in the Articles and the SHA), Mr Maloney had three votes, whereas Mr Coady and Mr McKelvey had one each.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Under the overall terms, the repayment of the full debt position was linked to the redemption of the entire equity held by Falcon VII in Topco &#8211; or, in the language used by the parties and their witnesses, the debt and the equity were &#8220;stapled&#8221; together. The equity had to be redeemed simultaneously with full repayment of the SF Notes, and vice versa. This follows from (in particular) clause 9.5 of the SFA Conditions and from the provisions in the Articles and the SHA relating to an &#8220;ICG Realisation Event&#8221;, including the definition of this term.  An ICG Realisation Event involves both (a) full repayment under the SF Notes/SFA and (b) the redemption of Falcon VII&#8217;s Original A1 shares in Topco.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="2">

Indeed, the general shape and contents of Falcon VII&#8217;s likely case were already clear, from Lord Wolfson KC&#8217;s submissions. It followed that, although late, the amendments would not cause any real disruption to the trial process or any real unfairness or prejudice to Falcon VII.  I therefore indicated that the amendments would be allowed, on Day 2 of the trial &#8211; 15 January 2025 &#8211; and gave directions as to how they should be pleaded out.</p>

However, following the careful explanations given by both sides as to what they intended to say, there were no surprises. In the event, neither side suggested that it had been unable to deal with the other&#8217;s amendments, and neither suggested that they had been prejudiced. On the contrary, it was apparent to me that each of them fully understood and was prepared for the other&#8217;s arguments.</p>

These were matters that fell within covenants 1, 6 and 13, in Schedule 5 to the SHA, Part D.  No Lender Investor Consent had been given.

This arises from Mr Maloney&#8217;s participation in and votes at the Workhuman board meetings of 29 May and 20 June 2023, and from his actions in relation to the 21 June 2023 Workhuman EGM (where he procured Bidco to vote in favour).</p>

So too was Mr Maloney&#8217;s participation in and his votes at the 8 August 2023 Workhuman board meeting, in relation to the Redemption Committee (because of covenant 12, in Schedule 5 Part D).  Similarly, in so far as Topco&#8217;s board meetings of 13 June, 18 July, 11 August and 22 August 2023 resulted in Topco taking steps in relation to an ICG Realisation Event, in circumstances where there had been breaches in relation to the Shareholder Resolutions, then Topco too was in breach (under covenant 24 in Schedule 5 Part B to the SHA).</p>

Furthermore, the occurrence of any Default Event or Services Default would mean that Mr Maloney thereupon lost his right to exercise three votes at the Topco board, pursuant to clauses 3.1 and 3.14 of the SHA. This in turn would affect Mr Maloney&#8217;s case as to the decisions that he says were taken at the Topco board meetings of 13 June, 18 July, 11 August and 22 August 2023.</p>

Mr Maloney&#8217;s case was that the same was also true for various other matters, notably steps taken by Topco (e.g., in appointing advisers and in engaging Morgan Stanley as AIB), in so far as they would otherwise require a Lender Investor Consent under paragraph 24 of Schedule 5 Part B to the SHA.</p>

Furthermore, &#8220;effected&#8221; must include not only the final act, but all steps taken in relation to the relevant object; and &#8220;the Buyer Group&#8221; includes Mr Maloney, when acting as director of a Buyer Group Company.

That iterative process requires the court to consider the text of the clause in question and that of any other provisions that are directly linked; and to consider the context of the contract as a whole and any directly related documents; and to consider the context of the overall factual matrix. If the contract is commercial, the court should also consider commerciality. Setting matters out in this sequence does not indicate that I regard the text as having primary significance so that it outranks the other elements of the unitary exercise.

In complex documents of the kind in issue there are bound to be ambiguities, infelicities and inconsistencies. An over-literal interpretation of one provision without regard to the whole may distort or frustrate the commercial purpose. This is one of those too frequent cases where a document has been subjected to the type of textual analysis more appropriate to the interpretation of tax legislation which has been the subject of detailed scrutiny at all committee stages than to an instrument securing commercial obligations: cf <span style="font-style:italic">Satyam Computer Services Ltd v Upaid Systems Ltd</span> [2008] EWCA Civ 487 at [2], [2008] 2 All ER (Comm) 465 at [2].&#8221;</p>

No SF Repayment has in fact been effected; nor, indeed, has an ICG Realisation Event been effected.  Mr Maloney therefore needs clause 5.4 to extend to mere steps taken, including steps taken by him rather than by either Topco or Bidco, which were intended to result in an ICG Realisation Event, but which have not (yet) had that effect.</p>

Nor were they strictly necessary for an SF Repayment or an ICG Realisation Event.  In theory, it would have been possible for the funds to be raised some other way: for example, if Mr Maloney had sufficient cash available, he could simply have paid on Bidco&#8217;s and Topco&#8217;s behalf.</p>

As the Workhuman board minutes of 29 May 2023 acknowledged, it was not certain that the shareholders would support the proposed Capital Reduction, or that the court in Ireland would sanction it; and, even if these conditions were satisfied, it was not certain that the funds released by the Capital Reduction would be distributed to the shareholders; nor was it certain how the shareholders would decide to use the money.  If (for example) there were to be a significant change in market conditions or the business outlook, the board of Workhuman or the board of Bidco or Topco might decide that the money would be better deployed for a different purpose.</p>

In this context, I heard a lot of submissions drawing on covenant 24 in Schedule 5 Part B, where the SHA uses the phrase &#8220;&#8230; instigate or take any steps in relation to an Exit or ICG Realisation Event&#8230;&#8221;. Mr Dhillon KC argued that the existence of this covenant supported his argument that &#8220;effected&#8221; in clause 5.4 also includes taking steps in relation to an ICG Realisation Event. Lord Wolfson KC argued that the fact that the parties were able to use the phrase &#8220;instigate or take any steps in relation to&#8230; an ICG Realisation Event&#8221;, in a provision where they regarded this as appropriate, was an indication that this was not the intended meaning of &#8220;effected&#8221; in clause 5.4.</p>

Any object or transaction that is more than extremely simple is likely to require more than one act, or step, in order for it to be achieved. Where this is so, effecting it will require those involved to take each such step. Thus, the real question is not whether &#8220;effected&#8221; in clause 5.4 does or may include &#8220;steps taken in relation to&#8221;: in principle, it may do. Rather, it is where the distinction is to be drawn between acts (or steps) that are merely preparatory, and acts (or steps) that actually effect the relevant object.</p>

This in turn requires determination of the Market Value of Topco; which requires the selection, engagement and instruction of the AIB; for which the very first step is (in practice) for one side to request the other to nominate an AIB.  It therefore can be said that Mr Maloney&#8217;s AIB Notice of 12 May 2023 was a step in effecting an ICG Realisation Event, because it was part of the machinery required under the SHA. This is so even though it was inevitable that any ICG Realisation Event would not be completed for several months after the AIB Notice, at the earliest.</p>

It may in fact have been necessary, in the sense that Mr Maloney had no other way of raising the necessary funds; although, without evidence as to his general wealth and business interests, I do not know whether or not he (i) might have had sufficient cash or (ii) might have been able to raise money, whether by borrowing via a personal loan or otherwise.  However, even if using the funds raised by Workhuman&#8217;s capital restructuring was the only option available to Mr Maloney, it was not necessary in the sense of being required under the terms of the SHA.  Furthermore, I have already noted that it was far from certain the steps that Mr Maloney and others took in May and June 2023 to bring about the capital restructuring would actually result in an ICG Realisation Event. These steps were merely preparatory.</p>

If Mr Maloney&#8217;s interpretation of clause 5.4 were correct, this would have the effect that an ICG Realisation Event could take place (including an ICG Drag as defined in the Topco Articles, which under Article 13 of the Topco Articles will involve an offer that Falcon VII is bound to accept), without Falcon VII&#8217;s consent, even though Falcon VII has not been able to comply with its money-laundering obligations and even though a sanctioned person is involved.

I have noted that clause 10.1 provides that, in general, Mr Maloney has primary responsibility for determining the timing of any Exit. However, after five years from the Completion Date (21 December 2018), the Topco board was to constitute an Exit Committee, and that Exit Committee would then determine the timing of the ICG Realisation Event (as well as structure, pricing and form). After six years from the Completion Date, Falcon VII could determine the timing, by giving or procuring a Lender Investor Direction. It seems unlikely that the parties can have intended clause 5.4 to have the effect of re-writing these provisions so that an ICG Realisation Event could take place, after five or six years, respectively, in a manner that would be inconsistent with this part of clause 10.  Clauses 10.5 to 10.9 establish other mechanics, not merely the Lender Investors&#8217; consent or approval, and so are beyond the scope of clause 5.4, even on Mr Maloney&#8217;s case.</p>

However, as the full text confirms, section 13 is concerned with a number of specific situations. The only one that Mr Maloney contended was applicable was (e) &#8211; but this involves &#8220;&#8230; a refinancing of the Senior Facility&#8221;. Mr Maloney&#8217;s proposed scheme did not involve any refinancing, in the ordinary sense of the word. The proposal was not essentially to obtain alternative finance from another source, to replace the finance originally provided by Falcon Financing/Falcon VII; it was to release Workhuman&#8217;s own capital resources, potentially without any financing at all.</p>

One legitimate way of reading the Term Sheet would be on the basis that the right to &#8220;force&#8221; an ICG Exit under section 13 depends on Mr Maloney having acted consistently with the rest of the Term Sheet provisions, including section 11. If Mr Maloney and the Buyer Group only arrived at the point of being able to replace the finance originally provided by ICG because they acted without consent and improperly under section 11, section 13 could not arise; at least if this constituted a Default Event.

In short, borrowing or capital reduction (etc.) that was not undertaken to fund an ICG Realisation Event might prejudice ICG&#8217;s interests, in so far as those interests would be ongoing; but there could be no prejudice to ICG where the objective was for ICG to exit.</p>

Nevertheless, this remains my view.  The issue is short and simple.  The correct answer is not in doubt.</p>

It means that, contrary to Mr Maloney&#8217;s understanding at the time, and contrary to his case before me, he could only cast one vote at those board meetings.

Mr Maloney relied on the outcome of these board meetings for a number of significant matters.  He said that, at the Topco board meeting of 13 June 2023, it had been resolved to appoint PwC, Capnua and McCann as Topco&#8217;s advisers, further to clause 10.4.1 of the SHA, and Morgan Stanley as AIB; that, at the Topco board meeting of 11 August 2023, it was resolved to appoint William Fry as Topco&#8217;s legal advisers; and that, at the Topco board meeting of 22 August 2023, it was resolved to engage Morgan Stanley, on the terms of the draft engagement letter and indemnity letter presented at that meeting.  My conclusion on the interpretation of clause 5.4 means that this is not the case.  Even in so far as votes were held (this being contentious in some instances), Mr Maloney was in the minority.</p>

However, I accept Mr Maloney&#8217;s evidence that, at the meetings of 13 June 2023 and 22 August 2023, he supported his own proposals in relation to the AIB (and other matters) and purported to cast three votes; and Mr Coady and Mr McKelvey each disagreed, each being entitled to one vote. The procedure followed was informal, but it was objectively clear that each side was intending to express its wishes in the normal manner, by reference to their respective voting capacities.  In other words, there was a vote.  However, for the reasons already given, Mr Maloney in fact had only one vote.  He therefore was outvoted on each occasion, by two votes to one.

This was required by the definition of &#8220;Independent Value&#8221;. It is noticeable that Morgan Stanley appears to have behaved as if its client, to whom it was answerable, was Topco, not Falcon VII.

They requested the information that they did because the relationship between Mr Maloney and Falcon VII had broken down, so that neither side trusted the other.

The requests made were wide, but this reflected the parties&#8217; divergent views as to clause 5.4 and their respective rights arising from it, and the generally acrimonious circumstances.
