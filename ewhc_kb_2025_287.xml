He is the founder and director of the energy company, Ecotricity Group Limited, an environmental campaigner and a major donor to the Labour Party. By this libel action, Mr Vince sues Lord (Shaun) Bailey of Paddington, a Conservative member of the Greater London Assembly, the former Conservative candidate for Mayor of London and, since 2023, a Conservative peer.</span></p>

In March 2024, there was a furore about remarks made by the prominent Conservative donor, Frank Hester, about the Rt. Hon Diane Abbott MP. Responding to that story, on 13 and 14 March 2024, Guido Fawkes published two articles in respect of Mr Vince&#8217;s views about Hamas. In the first article, Guido Fawkes published a 16-second extract from the longer Times Radio interview. Thereafter, a number of politicians and others commented on Mr Vince&#8217;s interview.</span></p>

He argues that the publications asserted that he supported or had endorsed the terrorist acts of Hamas, or that he was an apologist for Hamas and was himself an antisemite who had publicly defended Hamas as freedom fighters just two days after the October atrocity.

In a case where the facts are equally well known to both parties, what one of them says to the other is frequently nothing but an expression of opinion. The statement of such opinion is in a sense a statement of a fact, about the condition of the man&#8217;s own mind, but only of an irrelevant fact, for it is of no consequence what the opinion is. But if the facts are not equally known to both sides, then a statement of opinion by the one who knows the facts best involves very often a statement of a material fact, for he impliedly states that he knows facts which justify his opinion.&#8221;</span></p>

If the facts are stated separately and the comment appears as an inference drawn from those facts, any injustice that it might do will be to some extent negatived by the reader seeing the grounds upon which the unfavourable inference is based.

If so, it is a submission that I would endorse. I do not consider that Lord Nicholls was correct to require that the comment must identify the matters on which it is based with sufficient particularity to enable the reader to judge for himself whether it was well founded. The comment must, however, identify at least in general terms what it is that has led the commentator to make the comment, so that the reader can understand what the comment is about and the commentator can, if challenged, explain by giving particulars of the subject matter of his comment why he expressed the views that he did. A fair balance must be struck between allowing a critic the freedom to express himself as he will and requiring him to identify to his readers why it is that he is making the criticism.&#8221;</span></p>

If the statement did not indicate the basis for the opinion the analysis stops there and the defence fails. If it did, the condition is met and the analysis moves on to the next stage. The extraneous question of whether the matters indicated as the basis for the opinion are true or false is immaterial at this stage of the analysis.

Even though on foreign soil, the events of 7 October 2023 were, however, in that rare category of events that were so brutal and committed on such a scale that they attracted wall to wall media coverage. Even as the months passed, the events of 7 October 2023 and the identity of Hamas as a terrorist organisation were kept in the news by Israel&#8217;s invasion of Gaza and the continued detention of a substantial number of hostages. The 7 October attack achieved what Bean J referred to as &#8220;universal notoriety&#8221;. Accordingly, at the time of the publications in this case, I find that the fact that Hamas is a terrorist organisation and that it was responsible for the murder, rape and kidnap of Israeli citizens on 7 October 2023 were matters of common knowledge that can properly be taken into account when identifying the natural and ordinary meaning of these publications.</span></p>

The overall flavour of a programme may contribute to an interpretation which would not necessarily be found when subjecting the text to piecemeal analysis.

As the bane and antidote cases make clear, the court must consider the overall effect of the entire publication. In an extreme case a denial might in theory remove the defamatory sting altogether. More often it is, as Nicklin J observed, likely to downgrade the Chase level of a publication from a statement that the claimant is guilty of some conduct (level 1) to a statement that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the claimant is guilty (level 2) or even perhaps that there are grounds to investigate whether the claimant has committed the conduct alleged (level 3).</span></p>

He then recounted the substantial publicity gained by the Guido Fawkes articles and the tweets made by a number of politicians in the period immediately prior to Lord Bailey&#8217;s appearance on GB News and then his later crowd funding appeal. Mr Double concluded by inviting the court to infer that &#8220;in contrast to the ubiquity of the Guido Fawkes allegation in the mainstream media and on social media, that very few people would have watched the Times Radio interview in its entirety and therefore assessed what [Mr Vince] had said in its true and proper context&#8221;.</span></p>

He said that he prepared for his appearance with his wife, Ellie, who had researched news reports published on 13 and 14 March about Mr Vince&#8217;s words. Lord Bailey analysed Mr Vince&#8217;s interview albeit with reference to the same part of the interview that was extracted by Guido Fawkes. He insisted that Mr Vince was calling Hamas freedom fighters and explained that he called him an apologist because he believed that calling Hamas freedom fighters sought to sanitise the atrocities of a proscribed terrorist organisation.</span></p>

It is not uncommon for an application under Part 24 to give rise to a short point of law or construction and, if the court is satisfied that it has before it all the evidence necessary for the proper determination of the question and that the parties have had an adequate opportunity to address it in argument, it should grasp the nettle and decide it. The reason is quite simple: if the respondent&#8217;s case is bad in law, he will in truth have no real prospect of succeeding on his claim or successfully defending the claim against him, as the case may be.  Similarly, if the applicant&#8217;s case is bad in law, the sooner that is determined, the better.&#8221;</span></p>

Mr Price asserts that his client has no intention of publishing the letter and that there is no tangible benefit to the threatened-publication claim such that it is a </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:Garamond;font-size:11pt">Jameel</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:11pt"> abuse (being, of course, a reference to the court&#8217;s jurisdiction to stop as an abuse of process defamation proceedings that do no serve the legitimate purpose of protecting the claimant&#8217;s reputation as clarified in </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:Garamond;font-size:11pt">Jameel v.

He submits that the relevant parts of the imputation were that Mr Vince &#8220;acts as an apologist&#8221; for Hamas and that he &#8220;believes and says that Hamas are freedom fighters&#8221;. That, he argues, adds nothing to the imputations complained of in relation to the broadcast and the CrowdJustice publication. Further, he argues that such imputations clearly arise out of the Times Radio interview.</span></p>

While the application to decide additional preliminary issues was served in draft, there was no prior notice of the strike-out application before the application was served on 1 November. Mr Bennett argues that that was too late, that the claimant should not be bounced into having to deal with a late and unlisted application, and the fact that the parties are not geared up to address the point is reflected by the fact that the </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:Garamond;font-size:11pt">Jameel</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:11pt"> case is not even in their bundle of authorities.</span></p>

Unlike the position in respect of the application to determine further preliminary issues, the substance of the abuse point was not already before the court. Accordingly, if Lord Bailey decides to pursue his strike-out application then it will have to be listed for hearing. While the judge hearing the application will not be bound by the following observations, Lord Bailey might, however, want to take into account two particular matters in determining whether to do so:</span></p>

Such threat has not been acted upon but whether it has been withdrawn or remains real and credible would no doubt be important issues. An obvious way in which Lord Bailey could seek to address that issue would be by formally undertaking not to publish the letter.</span></p>
